    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I'm , an energetic and adaptable final year student in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Andhra University College of Engineering for Women. My academic journey has been marked by a strong foundation in electronics and communication engineering, complemented by a passion for the software field. During my studies, I gained comprehensive knowledge in programming languages such as  C, python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript,as well as database management with SQL and MySQL. My hands-on experience with development tools like Eclipse IDE and version control using GitHub has equipped me with the skills necessary to thrive in a dynamic team environment. I am excited to bring fresh ideas and a strong work ethic to my professional endeavors.</p>
    <p>Throughout my academic career, I have actively engaged in various projects that demonstrate my technical proficiency and problem-solving abilities. One of my notable projects is the System with Database Connectivity, which showcases my expertise in Python development and software engineering principles. My project on the Spech Recognition established a speech recognition system leveraging MATLAB’s several toolboxes and python along with extracting 
        vocabulary, syntax,and semantics from live spoken interactions with native speakers of a tribal language.</p>
    <p>Beyond my project work, I have gained valuable experience as a Student Lab Developer and Teaching Assistant at Andhra University. In these roles, I developed lab programs, mentored students, and reinforced lessons through one-on-one and small group sessions.My commitment to education and mentorship has not only enhanced my own understanding of the subject matter but also contributed to the academic success of my peers. These experiences have honed my ability to communicate complex technical concepts effectively and fostered a collaborative learning environment.</p>
    <p>I am thrilled to share that I have recently been placed at "BlackBucks" as a CHATGPT intern from june-july2024. This opportunity allows me to leverage my academic achievements and relevant skills in a professional setting, where I am eager to make a positive impact and drive success. In addition to my technical expertise, I bring certifications in Core and Advanced Python, Power BI, and AI tools, which further attest to my dedication to continuous learning and professional development. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, engaging in competitive programming, and spending time with family and friends. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or via email.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to connecting with you and exploring how we can work together to achieve great things.</p>
